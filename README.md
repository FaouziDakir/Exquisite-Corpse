# The Amazing Exquisite Corpse

**Start of the story**

We started our story with a devsecops oriented Git development 
The problem is : Git can be quite hard to learn when you are not used to ~~blablabla~~. 
And then the **exquisite corpse** himself came out from the grave and decided to become a great devops too. Someday he will become the CEO of a company for sure.
